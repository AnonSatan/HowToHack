    <h1>Learning to Hack: Metasploit Framework</h1>
    <h3>Let's Get Serious</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you know about <a href="https://github.com/AnonSatan/fierce.git">Fierce</a> and <a href="http://nmap.org/">nmap</a>,
        let's bring this all together with the <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit Framework</a> . You can
        view a <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/">Getting Started guide here</a>.
        Metasploit currently has over 800 tools and scripts for network testing. But the best feature, in my opinion, is
        that it integrates with the Postgresql database. So all of the data from your scans can be stored and searched
        with relative ease.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get started in the linux shell, issue the following commands:
            <pre>
                service postgresql start
                service metasploit start
            </pre>
    <p>
        The first time metasploit is run, it will take a few minutes to initialize the databases it needs. Then run:
    </p>
        <pre>
                msfconsole
            </pre>
    <p>
        You are now in the metasploit shell.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not going to go into the information provided in the Getting Started guide. I will offer up some tips on
        using Metasploit in console mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        I make frequent use of the
    </p>
            <pre>
                workspace -a new.workspace.name
            </pre>
    <p>
        command. This will add a workspace by the name of the domain I'm working with, just to keep everything
        organized. Now, remember that file we made with nmap? We can <a
            href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Using_the_Database#Importing_.26_Scanning">import
        the .xml file</a> into metasploit using the
    </p>
            <pre>
                db_import /path/to/xml/file
            </pre>
    <p>
        command. Now issue the
    </p>
            <pre>
                hosts
            </pre>
    <p>
        command to see the hosts that were imported into your workspace. If you now issue the
    </p>
            <pre>
                hosts -R
            </pre>
    <p>
        command, it will load all of the hosts that can now be used for whatever actions you may perform.
