    <h1>Learning to Hack: Introduction</h1>
    <h2>We have to start somewhere.</h2>
    <p>
        This introduction to hacking is meant to offer some general information to allow you to make your own decision about becoming a "hacker", or learning the hacking methodologies.  It really doesn't matter to anyone if you're a blackhat, whitehat, or grayhat, the principles and methods are the same.  I will only touch on generalities here.
    </p>
    <h3>A word or two about Operational Security. (OpSec)</h3>
    <p>
        In order to avoid the FBI party van, operational security is the most important aspect of hacking.  Learn all of the exploits you want, if you brag or just speak about your activities to the wrong person, you will be placed in jeopardy.  Seeking fame and hacking, in my opinion, are mutually exclusive.  If you can't STFU about it, don't do it.
    </p>
    <p>That is all.</p>
    <h3>Technical Security.</h3>
    <p>
        Anonymizing or masquerading your ISP's IP is the second most important aspect of hacking.  The FBI can't get to you if they can't find you.  Never, ever do anything illegal from your home IP.  There are two options that will masquerade your IP, a a VPN or Tor.  We will discuss these methods later on.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Patience to the extreme , portscanning dozens of IPs can take hours or days or even weeks.</li>
        <li>Dedication, this is a cat and mouse game with developers.  Exploits are discovered, precautions are taken.  Lather, rinse, repeat.</li>
        <li>Hardware, running virtual machines on your PC is hardware intensive.  RAM is your best friend, get as much as you can.  12Gb minimum.</li>
        <li>Continuous learning, old hacks, latest hacks, defense methods.  Anything pertaining to your craft.</li>
    </ul>
